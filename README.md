# Brightspace by D2L Survey Reports - Individual Attempts
Python script to pivot the data in a Brightspace by D2L Survey report (individual attempts) of Likert questions so that the questions are in columns instead of in rows. If there are multiple attempts on the survey, the responses are averaged.

The manual way of cleaning the data and creating the pivot table in Excel is shown in [this video](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/D2L+Survey+Report+PivotTable/1_jyh0yyk8).
